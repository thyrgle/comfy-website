<h1 class="title">Release v0.2: More Globals = More Comfy</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-10-15</strong></p>
<p>This is a second release of Comfy at version <code>v0.2.0</code>. In short it brings some
API improvements, greatly improved default performance on integrated GPUs, and
overall a lot of bugfixes &amp; small performance improvements.</p>
<h2 id="changelog">CHANGELOG</h2>
<p>The main change in this release is that <code>EngineContext</code> is not necessary to
pass around anymore. This should simplify a lot of the confusion, as the #1
question about Comfy from <em>many</em> people was about <code>GameContext</code> and
<code>EngineContext</code> and why are there two any why do we even need them.</p>
<p>Since Comfy already uses globals for many things, it makes sense to just
embrace this fully and move the remaining things to globals as well. Many
of the values provided in <code>EngineContext</code> were already available through
globals and just re-exported, so this shouldn't be a huge issue.</p>
<p>Comfy will still use <code>EngineContext</code> internally for some things, but this
won't be re-exported to the users as everything should be accessible by
other means.</p>
<p>List of removed things and where to find them now:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>c.delta</code> -&gt; <code>delta()</code>. This is likely going to be something that most users
(including us) will re-export into their <code>GameContext/GameState</code> anyway.</li>
<li><code>c.world()</code> -&gt; <code>world()</code>. ECS world already lived in a single instance, it's
now moved into a single global.</li>
<li><code>c.commands()</code> -&gt; <code>commands()</code>. Same as above.</li>
<li><code>c.cooldowns()</code> -&gt; <code>cooldowns()</code>. This might be worth re-exporting into
<code>GameContext</code> if accessed frequently, but in either way there's no extra
overhead compared to before.</li>
<li><code>c.mouse_world</code> -&gt; <code>mouse_world()</code>. This already existed before, and may
also be worth re-exporting anyway.</li>
<li><code>c.egui</code> -&gt; <code>egui()</code>. Note that before this was a field, now it's a
global function. Though in this case <code>egui::Context</code> is already
internally <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;ContextImpl&gt;&gt;</code>, so this function is actually very
cheap to call as it just returns a <code>&amp;'static egui::Context</code> :)</li>
<li><code>c.egui_wants_mouse</code> -&gt; <code>egui().wants_pointer_input()</code></li>
<li><code>c.config</code> -&gt; <code>game_config()</code> and <code>game_config_mut()</code>.</li>
<li><code>c.cached_loader.borrow_mut()</code> -&gt; <code>cached_loader_mut()</code> (for <code>&amp;</code> just
omit <code>_mut</code>).</li>
<li>similarly <code>c.changes.borrow_mut()</code> -&gt; <code>changes()</code> and <code>c.notifications.borrow_mut()</code> -&gt; <code>notifications()</code>.
The last three were undocumented and are not really intended for public
use yet, but documenting them here anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Comfy still includes many APIs which are not currently documented but are
still exposed. The current goal is to work through codebase and cleanup some
odd bits and document them at the same time. If you find something that is not
mentioned on the website or any examples, it's very likely to change in the
future.</p>
<p>As a secondary note, it should be noted that comfy is still <em>very early</em> on in
its lifecycle. Comfy will do its best not to break existing games, but we may
need to iterate on some ideas, and some of them might be controversial, such
as the use of globals.</p>
<p>Comfy is not a project ran by RFCs, and while we do appreciate feedback, some
things have to be figured out by actually using the tool to build games,
running benchmarks, and making decisions based on real world usage.</p>
<p>In our usage of Comfy we've found many things that many in the Rust community
would consider &quot;bad ideas&quot; to be incredible boosts in ergonomics and
productivity. This is something that seems to happen more often than not, and
as such we're not really afraid to make changes like the above where a large
portion of the state is moved into globals. If you find the above change
unacceptable and what we had before &quot;good&quot;, maybe take a look at the source
code and see how many globals we already had :)</p>
<p>That being said, the #1 priority of Comfy is and always will be making real
games. If any changes we make become problematic <em>in real world use cases</em>,
please do report these. If you think something is slow, please submit a
benchmark showing this. Comfy has enough examples using all of the systems, and
a builtin integration with Tracy, so it should be easy to extend. We do care
about reasonable games performing well on consumer hardware, but we do not care
about being the fastest at rendering 500k particles.</p>
<p>Our own games are not locked behind on an ancient version of Comfy, and we're
doing our best to stay up to date with the latest changes, to make sure things
are actually working smoothly.</p>
<h2 id="bloom">Bloom</h2>
<p>Comfy <code>v0.1.0</code> had bloom turned on by default. This turned out to be quite
problematic on older integrated GPUs as some users reported, as the builtin
bloom does 20 blur passes :)</p>
<p>In <code>v0.2.0</code> bloom is now turned off by default. You can still enable it by
calling <code>game_config_mut().bloom_enabled = true;</code>. There's also a <a href="https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy/blob/master/comfy/examples/bloom.rs">new
example</a>
that showcases bloom and how it can be configured.</p>
<h2 id="chromatic-aberration">Chromatic aberration</h2>
<p>Comfy <code>v0.1.0</code> also had chromatic aberration enabled by default, but
considering this isn't even a documented feature and the API for using it is
quite ugly we turned it off for now in <code>v0.2.0</code>. I don't think there's any
chance anyone actually used it, but if you did, it'll come back soon I promise.</p>
<p>Post processing is one of the things that should improve after <code>v0.2.0</code> is out,
and we'll be able to add more effects and make them easier to use.</p>
<h2 id="asset-loading">Asset loading</h2>
<p>Comfy does include a parallel asset asynchronous asset loader, although the API
isn't currently great and is going to be improved/changed in some ways. Related
issues <a href="https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy/pull/42">#42</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy/pull/30">#30</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy/issues/36">#36</a> for those that are curious.</p>
<p>An example of how this works can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy-benchmark/tree/master/comfy-asset-benchmark">Comfy Asset
Benchmark</a>,
but this issue remains relatively undocumented for the time being as there will
be breaking changes around it.</p>
<p>The functionality is there and it is being used in production already.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
<p>While Comfy is not an engine that focuses on speed, that doesn't mean
performance is not important and shouldn't be tracked. There's now a <a href="https://github.com/darthdeus/comfy-benchmark">WIP Comfy
benchmark</a> that includes both an
asset loading benchmark, as well as a small comparison between Comfy and the
official Bevymark, and also links to a few other references (e.g. Kha).</p>
<p><em><strong>TL;DR: On my machine Bevy does ~120k sprites at 60FPS, Comfy does 35k, and
Kha in a similar benchmark does 300k. We'd like to be as fast if not faster
than Bevy with the next release :) It's unlikely Comfy will get anywhere close Kha,
but there is no reason we shouldn't want to be a little bit faster than we're right now.</strong></em></p>
<p>Again, it's not the goal of Comfy to be the fastest renderer in the universe,
but being able to not think about &quot;is this going to be slow&quot; while writing
gameplay code is important, so the aim should be to at least be as fast as the
slower engines out there.</p>
<h2 id="minor-changes">Minor changes:</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>GameConfig</code> is no longer <code>Copy</code>. This shouldn't really affect anyone in
any way, as it was behind a <code>RefCell</code> anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-up">Next up</h2>
<p>The global namespace is currently polluted by a lot of things. The next
<code>v0.3.0</code> release will focus on cleaning this up and making some things more
directly accessible (e.g. some globals which are now currently not public).</p>
